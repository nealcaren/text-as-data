The emphasis is on application. How can you collect and analyze thousands of web pages, historical documents or Tweets? What are the best practices for turning words into numbers?\r\n\r\nThe tutorials are designed for people who may be familiar with a standard statistical program, such as Stata or SPSS, or perhaps a qualitative analysis program like NVivo, but who haven’t done any quantitative text analysis or used Python. Python is an open-source computer language that is quite popular amongst computer programmers. Computational linguistics and computer scientists have developed a large number of add-ons for Python that make it a popular choice for quantitative text analysis.\r\n\r\nYou can also [download](https://github.com/nealcaren/text-as-data/zipball/master) most of the pages and code (as IPython notebooks).\r\n\r\n\r\n**Introduction**\r\n* [Part 1](http://nealcaren.web.unc.edu/an-introduction-to-text-analysis-with-python-part-1/)\r\n* [Part 2](http://nealcaren.web.unc.edu/an-introduction-to-text-analysis-with-python-part-2/)\r\n* [Part 3](http://nealcaren.web.unc.edu/an-introduction-to-text-analysis-with-python-part-3/)\r\n\r\n**Data collection**\r\n* Scraping Web Pages\r\n    * [Grabbing lacrosse scores](http://nealcaren.github.io/text-as-data/html/scraping_lax.html)\r\n* Using APIs\r\n     * [Sushi Bars and Buffets: Measuring local culture with the Yelp API](http://nealcaren.github.io/text-as-data/html/yelp_api.html)\r\n     * [Analyzing Buzzfeed headlines with the Twitter API](http://nealcaren.github.io/text-as-data/html/buzzfeed_and_tweets.html)\r\n\r\n**Analysis**\r\n* Word Frequencies\r\n     * [How the New York Times writes about men and women]\r\n(http://nealcaren.github.io/text-as-data/html/times_gender.html)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Other**\r\n* [Generating field hockey power ratings](http://nealcaren.github.io/text-as-data/html/field_hockey.html)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
