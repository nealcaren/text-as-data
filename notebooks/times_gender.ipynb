One quick way to answer that \nquestion\nis to compare the words in sentences that discuss women with the words in sentences that\ndiscuss men. Here's an example of how to do this sort of analysis using Python. \n\nThe data comes from last week's (February 27, 2013-March 6, 2013) *New York Times*. I downloaded\nall the articles available through LexisNexis excluding only the corrections and paid\nobituaries. This totals 1,379 articles, or about 200 per day. Using a modified version of an old Python \n[script](http://nealcaren.web.unc.edu/cleaning-up-lexisnexis-files/), I removed all the\nmetadata. put the text\nof each article in its own file, and placed all of the text files in a folder called `articles`. \nIt is not the most efficient way to go about it, but sometimes the text data comes that way\nso I thought I would be useful to set it up that way for didactic purposes.

Similarly,\nthe male list is also tied to recent news events, as one one would expect from data from a newspaper. \nThese lists also just reported the extreme words, many of which were only used in a handful of articles. A \nmore rigorous analysis would probably look at the complete distribution of words.\n\nI should also add that after I ran this analysis for the first time, I noticed a \nfew words, like 'spokesman' and 'actress' that should have been included on the original lists. \n\nIf you wanted to output the full table, you could easily write it to a tab delimited file."

Now, this is just based on\nword frequencies, and a more nuanced examination would probably discover additionally findings of interest.\nFor example, my guess is that that 'work', near the bottom of this list, is used not only more\nfrequently in the female subject sentences, but also in a different context and as a different\npart of speech (e.g. 'men work', 'women juggle home and work responsibilities.'). Comparing\nword frequencies only gets you so far, but it is pretty quick and easy way to \nconduct some preliminary data analysis."
